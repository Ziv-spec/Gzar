# Gzar
My toy language which I will use to learn more about compilers. 

## What will the Language support? 
The language will support functions, variables, logical and mathematical operations on constants and variables. 
The language might support pointers (we shall see) and if I will have the time, even strings. 

## Code generation
The compiler will output unoptimized assembly at first. Then at some point if I will feel like it, I will transition to machine code directly. 
This will intern, make the compiler not dependent on any piece of software other than the microsoft linker.
