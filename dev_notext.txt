internal Token get_next_token(Lexer *lexer) 
is a bad idea, for two reasons: 
1. this does not give you any info about wehther the token was create or not 
2. this does not allow you to just "eat" tokens with a more sane looking code. 

another thing: 
I need to have a concreate idea of what are the fundemental units that I need 
to use in my compiler. An expression, statement and so on... 
What are the relationships between them (like how groups, unary, binary, and literal are all expressions). 
All of this is needed to be able to create a good structure for the compiler.

When defining a langauge you need to make the specify the grammer of that language
quite clearly. Doing this well will really help you when programming the compiler for 
said language
